                <h3>How to Play Game?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initially, some blocks will be randomly filled. Players need to take sufficient time to move the blocks one by one until all the blocks are filled.</li>
                    <li>Once all the blocks are filled, an alert box will display the message "You Finished The Game Successfully!"</li>
                    <li>To complete the game, players need to move each block logically based on the positions of the filled blocks.</li>
                    <li>Press "New Game" to restart the game from the initial state.</li>
                </ul>
            </dialog>
        </section>
    </main>

   <div class="addendum">
    <h3>Addendum:</h3>
    <p>1. The main objective of the game is to fill all the default boxes with colors. Once this is accomplished, a message saying "You Win!" will appear in an alert box.</p>
    <p>2. A 5x5 board is created in a grid format, with some boxes randomly filled with color at the beginning.</p>
    <p>3. Players must logically manipulate the boxes to turn off all colored ones.</p>
    <p>4. The "New Game" button restarts the game, resetting it to the initial state, while the "Learn Game Rules" button displays a dialog box with instructions, which can be closed by the player.</p>
    <p>5. A 5x5 grid is formed using CSS grid layout. The visual design and user experience depend on the proper sizing of the cells and the spacing between them.</p>
    <p>6. The random starting state of the colors adds replayability. At least one box is filled initially to keep the player engaged.</p>
    <p>7. Balancing the game's difficulty was challenging due to the random initial setup. Multiple configurations were tested, ensuring at least one box starts with a color to provide a fair challenge.</p>
    <p>8. Providing clear visual feedback for color toggling was complex. Players' actions are immediately reflected through CSS classes that control the color states and update the DOM elements.</p>
    <p>9. Thoughtful planning of the user interface and event handling for each cell was essential in creating an intuitive, responsive experience. Smooth interactions and a responsive layout helped deliver an engaging and user-friendly game.</p>
    <p>10. The game detects a win when all the colored boxes are turned off. Once completed, the game offers instant feedback and gratification to the player.</p>
